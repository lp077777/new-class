<h2>Two Texas-based airlines said they will still require their workers to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, despite a new executive order from Gov. Greg Abbott (R) banning all vaccine mandates in the state.</h2>
<p>Dallas-based Southwest Airlines said it will still seek to meet the Biden administration’s demand that contractors of the federal government get their workforce vaccinated.</p>
<br />
<p>Fort Worth-based American Airlines, which employed 102,700 people at the end of last year, said in a statement that Abbott’s order “does not change anything for American.”</p>
<br />
<p>Southwest CEO Gary Kelly expressed personal opposition to the Biden administration’s mandate <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/cnbc-transcript-southwest-airlines-chairman-ceo-gary-kelly-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-on-the-street-today.html">during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday</a> — but said it sees no other way to proceed. Southwest had more than 60,000 employees in 2019.</p>
