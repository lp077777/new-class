 <!-- browser working flow
   1. enter url , browser will using DNS , change the url to real IP address, using IP address to find the server
   2. using TCP Handshake to connect, now mostly we are using https, there will be an extra step, 
   using TLS handshake to build an encryption channel, to protect the data won't be changed or monitored
   3. after built the channel , the browser will rasie a http(s) request  to get data, 
   with slow start policy , browser will get first 14kb html , then get others
   4. after get the code , browser will start to render the page:
     build DOM tree, using main thread, it will run html code line by line , when there is a js  script tag , it will run js, 
     this time the main thread will stop html render , only when js code running completed , then it will go back to html,
     with link,img, or script async, script defer, it won't stop DOM render
     build CSSOM tree
     combine DOM tree and CSSOM tree
     layout 
     display, if have img reflow, it will reredner
    run script defer async

// what is web : 1. website, webpage_html 
// webpage constitute the web, and elements constitute the webpage, like picture, text, link, video 
what is HTML : Hyper Text Markup Language , it's a language to discribe the web, it's not a coding language , just a markup language
it's a markup tag

why it's hyper text markup language, not only text , but also picture, video ...
it can also redirect to another file 

webpage is constitute by elements , these elements are discribed by html tags, rendered by browser
    -->
    <!-- chrome browser  the render engine : Blink
    Web standard  W3C 
    why we need web standard , different browser display is different, 
    so using standard can help different browser to show the same thing 
    and it's easy to maintain

    structure : The structure is used to organize and classify web page elements. At this stage, it is mainly html

    presentation : is used to set the layout, color, size and other appearance styles of web page elements, CSS

    behavior:Behavior refers to the definition of web page model and the coding of interaction JS

    structure, presentation and behavior should be seperate

      1. the coding standards:
      all the tag should be in <> and should be a pair ,  some may not need , like <br />
      Containment relationship & Constellation

      2. the html frame tag
      every webpage should have a basic contructure tag, all the details shoulde be in the tag
      the head tag must have title, and the content should be in body tag
      <!DOCTYPE> declare tag, tell the browser which version html should be rendered, must be the first line, not a html tag
      lang is language , en is English , zh-CN is chinese
      character set Is a collection of multiple characters, UTF-8 is Universal Code, contain almost all the language
      using different tags can make the page more clear and easy to understand
      
      header tage <h1> to <h6>, the h tag will block one line , and from 1 to 6 it will be smaller, all h tag is bold
      <p></p> can divide the context to different paragragh
      <br / > means break , force line break br is a single tag 
      text formatting: <strong> <b>  ;   <em> <i> ; <del><s> ; <ins> <u> prefer to use the first one 
         <div >  and <span> they are box for display div is division  one div will block one line , but one line can have a lot of spans
            implement img  using <img src="" /> src is the attri , must set 
      3. the hyper link tag
      4. picture tag and the difference between  alt and title,  the biggest one , <html> tag
