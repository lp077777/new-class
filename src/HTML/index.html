// what is web : 1. website, webpage_html 
// webpage constitute the web, and elements constitute the webpage, like picture, text, link, video 
what is HTML : Hyper Text Markup Language , it's a language to discribe the web, it's not a coding language , just a markup language
it's a markup tag

why it's hyper text markup language, not only text , but also picture, video ...
it can also redirect to another file 

webpage is constitute by elements , these elements are discribed by html tags, rendered by browser
    -->
    <!-- chrome browser  the render engine : Blink
    Web standard  W3C 
    why we need web standard , different browser display is different, so using standard can help different browser to show the same thing 
    and it's easy to maintain

    structure : The structure is used to organize and classify web page elements. At this stage, it is mainly html

    presentation : is used to set the layout, color, size and other appearance styles of web page elements, CSS

    behavior:Behavior refers to the definition of web page model and the coding of interaction JS

    structure, presentation and behavior should be seperate

      1. the coding standards:
      all the tag should be in <> and should be a pair ,  some may not need , like <br />
      Containment relationship & Constellation

      2. the html frame tag
      every webpage should have a basic contructure tag, all the details shoulde be in the tag
      the head tag must have title, and the content should be in body tag
      <!DOCTYPE> declare tag, tell the browser which version html should be rendered, must be the first line, not a html tag
      lang is language , en is English , zh-CN is chinese
      character set Is a collection of multiple characters, UTF-8 is Universal Code, contain almost all the language
      using different tags can make the page more clear and easy to understand
      
      header tage <h1> to <h6>, the h tag will block one line , and from 1 to 6 it will be smaller, all h tag is bold
      <p></p> can divide the context to different paragragh
      <br / > means break , force line break br is a single tag 
      text formatting: <strong> <b>  ;   <em> <i> ; <del><s> ; <ins> <u> prefer to use the first one 
         <div >  and <span> they are box for display div is division  one div will block one line , but one line can have a lot of spans
            implement img  using <img src="" /> src is the attri , must set 
      3. the hyper link tag
      4. picture tag and the difference between  alt and title,  the biggest one , <html> tag
